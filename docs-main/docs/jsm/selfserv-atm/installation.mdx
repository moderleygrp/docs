### 2) Product Insertion {#2}
Insert your file by 'dragging' the product file into Roblox Studio with your game fully loaded. Use `CTRL + U` to ungroup the model.

Your game will need to be published for the product to work.

### 3) Folder Movement {#3}
Move `JSM | ATM Tools` into **ServerStorage**. You must keep the name of the folder.

### 4) Customisation {#4}
You can customise your ATM through the `Settings` script in each ATM. You can also change the screen, though we don't provide support for creating UI themes.

With the debit card, you can place it into the `StarterPack` which will give **everyone** the item by default. Or, you can also make your own script and provide it to specific users. It depends on how you'd like to use it. You can also change the 'advertise here' placement. Change it to a decal, update it to some text. The possibilities are endless, but you can also colour it the same as the ATM to blend the sign if you're not a fan of it.
