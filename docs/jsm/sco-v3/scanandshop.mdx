### 2) Product Insertion {#2}

Insert your file by 'dragging' the product file into Roblox Studio with your game fully loaded. If this does not work, right click on Workspace, click "Insert from file" and select the file.

Your game will need to be published for the product to work.

### 3) Folder Movement {#3}

Move the JSM | Scan & Shop folder into the Accessories folder of your JSM Self Checkouts.

### 4) System Configuration {#4}

Scan & Shop does not have a proprietary configuration file. Instead, all the configuration for S&S is held in the Self Checkout SystemConfig, under Scan&ShopSettings. Below you can find info on each of the settings.
